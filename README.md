This project was written while reading book 'Practical unit testing with JUnit and Mockito' by Tomek Kaczanowski,
it contains tests from exercises given in book.

It actually can contain some mistakes, but general picture of the project seems to be pretty good, tests are short,
cover most cases, functionalities implemented are also short.

I was looking for good examples how to test for months, because on my job we don't write tests.
And when I started occasionally to write some, I always got bad feeling about it, I felt no profit from writing
tests at all. So once on SO I stumbled upon this book, and it very helped me to understand, answered 
many questions and gave good practice.
